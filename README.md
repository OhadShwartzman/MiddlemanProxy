# MiddleMan Proxy

In this repository you may find my implementation of a rather basic proxy. 

## How to use:

Currently not relevant, since I have not yet made a module which would connect everything together. will be updated

## TODO:
    -   Make a 'main' function of some sort, which will run everything.
    -   Add user interaction with the program - filter packets, display packets differently, etc.
